Cross-referencing the scene graph, room 309 has a ceiling with a 'size' dimension key of '6.382, 7.78, 0.0'. Therefore, the defect node corresponds to the ceiling component in room 309.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Check Reachability:** To address the ceiling stain, we examine robots’ ‘max_reach_height'. The defect ceiling's height (3.7m) is key. Robots with a ‘max_reach_height’ greater than 3.7 meters can reach it. Robots 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, and 10 meet this criterion, making them suitable for ceiling stain tasks.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Generate Navigation Paths:** From room 314 to 309, I mapped a path through connecting doors: 314-313 via door 23, 313-312 via door 21, 312-311 via 20, 311-5 via 28, and finally, 5-309 via door 18.
