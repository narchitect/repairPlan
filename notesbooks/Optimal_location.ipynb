      "### Chain of Thought:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Understanding the Environment:**\n",
      "   - The defect is located on the floor at coordinates `{'x': -26.1239, 'y': -10.06045, 'z': 0.0}`.\n",
      "   - The room (space) where the defect is located has dimensions `{'x': 8.168, 'y': 5.181, 'z': 3.7}` and is centered at `{'x': -26.1239, 'y': -10.06045, 'z': 7.85}`.\n",
      "   - The room contains walls, a ceiling, and a door, which may act as obstacles or boundaries for the robot's movement and scanning.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Field of View (FOV) Consideration:**\n",
      "   - The camera has a 90-degree FOV, which means it can cover a wide area in front of it. The FOV will be important in determining the distance from the defect to ensure the entire defect is within the camera's view.\n",
      "   - The defect is on the floor, so the robot should ideally be positioned at a height above the floor to capture the defect from a top-down or angled perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Room and Defect Dimensions:**\n",
      "   - The defect is located on the floor, which has dimensions `{'x': 8.168, 'y': 5.181, 'z': 0.0}`. This means the defect could be spread across a significant area, and the robot needs to be positioned to capture the entire defect.\n",
      "   - The room has a height of 3.7 meters, so the robot can be positioned at various heights to get a better view of the defect.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Obstacle Considerations:**\n",
      "   - The walls are located at the boundaries of the room, and the door is located at `{'x': -21.97, 'y': -8.12, 'z': 1.013}`. These elements may restrict the robot's movement, but they do not directly obstruct the view of the defect on the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Optimal Scanning Location:**\n",
      "   - The robot should be positioned at a height above the defect to capture it from a top-down or angled perspective.\n",
      "   - The robot should be positioned at a distance from the defect such that the entire defect is within the camera's FOV.\n",
      "   - The robot should avoid being too close to the walls or other obstacles to ensure it has a clear view of the defect.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Calculating the Optimal Distance:**\n",
      "   - The defect's size is `{'x': 8.168, 'y': 5.181, 'z': 0.0}`. To capture the entire defect, the robot needs to be positioned at a distance where the camera's FOV can cover this area.\n",
      "   - The FOV of the camera is 90 degrees, which means the camera can cover a wide area in front of it. The formula to calculate the distance required to cover a certain width with a given FOV is:\n",
      "\n",
      "     \\[\n",
      "     \\text{distance} = \\frac{\\text{width}}{2 \\times \\tan(\\frac{\\text{FOV}}{2})}\n",
      "     \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "     For a 90-degree FOV, the formula simplifies to:\n",
      "\n",
      "     \\[\n",
      "     \\text{distance} = \\frac{\\text{width}}{2}\n",
      "     \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "     - The width of the defect is approximately 8.168 meters (along the x-axis), so the robot should be positioned at a distance of:\n",
      "\n",
      "     \\[\n",
      "     \\text{distance} = \\frac{8.168}{2} = 4.084 \\text{ meters}\n",
      "     \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Choosing the Optimal Height:**\n",
      "   - The robot should be positioned at a height that allows it to capture the defect from an overhead or angled perspective. A height of around 1.5 to 2 meters would provide a good view of the defect without being too close to the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Final Position:**\n",
      "   - The robot should be positioned at a distance of approximately 4.084 meters from the center of the defect along the y-axis (since the defect is centered at `y = -10.06045`).\n",
      "   - The robot should be positioned at a height of around 1.5 to 2 meters above the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Optimal Location Calculation:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The defect is centered at `{'x': -26.1239, 'y': -10.06045, 'z': 0.0}`.\n",
      "- The robot should be positioned at a distance of 4.084 meters along the y-axis, so the optimal y-coordinate is:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \\[\n",
      "  y_{\\text{optimal}} = -10.06045 + 4.084 = -5.97645\n",
      "  \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "- The robot should be positioned at a height of around 1.5 to 2 meters, so the optimal z-coordinate is:\n",
      "\n",
      "  \\[\n",
      "  z_{\\text{optimal}} = 1.5 \\text{ to } 2.0\n",
      "  \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "- The x-coordinate remains the same as the defect's x-coordinate, which is `x = -26.1239`.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Understanding the Environment**:\n",
      "   - The defect is located on the floor at coordinates `{'x': -26.1239, 'y': -10.06045, 'z': 0.0}`.\n",
      "   - The room (ID: 119) has a size of `{'x': 8.168, 'y': 5.181, 'z': 3.7}` and is bounded by walls, a ceiling, and a door.\n",
      "   - The robot's camera has a 90-degree Field of View (FOV), meaning it can capture a wide area but needs to be positioned carefully to cover the defect and avoid obstacles.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Defining the Problem**:\n",
      "   - The goal is to find the optimal location for the robot to scan the defect on the floor.\n",
      "   - The robot should be positioned such that the defect is within the camera's FOV, and the robot should avoid obstacles like walls and doors.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Analyzing the Defect Location**:\n",
      "   - The defect is located at `{'x': -26.1239, 'y': -10.06045, 'z': 0.0}`.\n",
      "   - The defect is on the floor, so the robot's camera should be positioned at a height above the floor (z > 0) to capture the defect.\n",

      "   - The camera has a 90-degree FOV, which means it can cover a wide area in front of it. The robot should be positioned such that the defect is within this FOV.\n",
      "   - The FOV can be visualized as a cone extending from the camera's position. The camera should be placed at a distance where the defect is within this cone.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Avoiding Obstacles**:\n",
      "   - The room has walls at the following locations:\n",
      "     - Wall 1: `{'x': -26.1239, 'y': -7.47, 'z': 1.85}` (north wall)\n",

      "   - The robot should avoid being too close to these walls to ensure the camera has a clear view of the defect.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Calculating the Optimal Position**:\n",
      "   - The robot should be positioned at a height above the floor to capture the defect. A reasonable height for the camera would be around 1.5 meters (z = 1.5), which is typical for scanning floors.\n",
      "   - The robot should be positioned at a distance from the defect such that the defect is within the camera's FOV. Given the 90-degree FOV, the robot should be positioned at a distance where the defect is within a 45-degree angle from the camera's centerline.\n",
      "   - The robot should be positioned along the y-axis (north-south direction) to avoid the east and west walls. A position along the y-axis, slightly north or south of the defect, would provide a clear view.\n",
