      "9 1. **Defect Analysis**: The defect is a crack on a wall located at coordinates (x: -0.26, y: -23.56855, z: 1.85) in room 331. The wall has a size of (x: 0.0, y: 11.78, z: 3.7). The crack is likely to require smoothing and possibly filling.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Task Requirements**: The task involves smoothing the surface of the wall, which suggests the need for a robot capable of performing the 'smoothSurface' action. Additionally, the robot should be able to handle 'filler' material if filling is required.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Robot Capability Analysis**:\n",
      "   - **Robot 1**: Can perform 'smoothSurface' but has a max reach height of 2000 mm.\n",
      "   - **Robot 2**: Can perform 'smoothSurface' with a max reach height of 3000 mm.\n",
      "   - **Robot 3**: Can perform 'smoothSurface' with a max reach height of 3700 mm.\n",
      "   - **Robot 4**: Can perform 'smoothSurface' but has a max reach height of 2000 mm.\n",
      "   - **Robot 5**: Can perform 'smoothSurface' with a max reach height of 3700 mm.\n",
      "   - **Robot 6**: Cannot perform 'smoothSurface'.\n",
      "   - **Robot 7**: Cannot perform 'smoothSurface'.\n",
      "   - **Robot 8**: Cannot perform 'smoothSurface'.\n",
      "   - **Robot 9**: Can perform 'smoothSurface' and handle 'filler' with a max reach height of 3700 mm.\n",
      "   - **Robot 10**: Cannot perform 'smoothSurface'.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Reachability Analysis**: The defect is located at a height of 1.85 meters (1850 mm). All robots with a max reach height of 2000 mm or more can reach this defect.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Best Robot Selection**: Robot 9 is selected because it can perform the 'smoothSurface' action, handle 'filler' material, and has a max reach height of 3700 mm, which is more than sufficient to reach the defect at 1850 mm. Additionally, Robot 9 is specifically equipped with a scraper and brush, which are ideal for smoothing and filling tasks.\n"
