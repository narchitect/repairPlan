      "   - **Reasoning:**\n",
      "     - The stain is on the ceiling, which is located at a height of **3.7 meters**.\n",
      "     - We need to check which robots can reach this height. The following robots have the following maximum reach heights:\n",
      "       - **Robot 1**: Max reach height = 2.0 meters (cannot reach the ceiling).\n",
      "       - **Robot 2**: Max reach height = 3.0 meters (cannot reach the ceiling).\n",
      "       - **Robot 3**: Max reach height = 3.7 meters (can reach the ceiling).\n",
      "       - **Robot 4**: Max reach height = 2.0 meters (cannot reach the ceiling).\n",

      "       - **Robot 10**: Max reach height = 2.0 meters (cannot reach the ceiling).\n",
      "     - Therefore, **robots 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9** can reach the ceiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Generate Navigation Paths:**\n",
      "   - **Reasoning:**\n",
      "     - The robot is currently in **room 332**, and the defect is in **room 320**. We need to find a path from **room 332** to **room 320**.\n",

      "### 4. **Check Accessibility:**\n",
      "   - **Reasoning:**\n",
      "     - We need to check if the robots can pass through the doors along the navigation path.\n",
      "     - The door dimensions along the path are as follows:\n",
      "       - **Door 219** (between rooms 332 and 290): Width = 2.0 meters.\n",
      "       - **Door 448** (between rooms 3 and 320): Width = 2.0 meters.\n",

To identify the target defect node, I will look at the scene graph for the ceiling elements associated with room id 309. The ceiling elements are identified by their type and location. In this case, I will find the ceiling element that corresponds to room id 309.\n",

    "     - robot4 (3.7 m) - can just reach the ceiling\n",
    "   - **Reasoning:** Robots 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 cannot reach the ceiling since their maximum reach heights are less than 3.7 meters. Only robots 4 and 10 can reach the stain.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generate Navigation Paths:**\n",
    "   - The robot is currently in room id 314 and needs to navigate to room id 309. The path will involve navigating through doors.\n",
    "   - The navigation path from room id 314 to room id 309 can be constructed by checking the doors connecting these rooms.\n",
    "   - From the scene graph, I will find the doors that connect room id 314 to room id 309.\n",
    "   - The path may look like this: \n",
    "     - Room 314 → Door connecting to Room 310 → Room 310 → Door connecting to Room 309 → Room 309.\n",
    "   - **Path Representation:** \n",
    "     - Path: [314, door_id_1, 310, door_id_2, 309]\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **Check Accessibility:**\n",
    "   - For the navigation path, I will check the sizes of the doors against the sizes of the robots.\n",
    "   - I will extract the door sizes from the scene graph and compare them with the sizes of the robots.\n",
    "   - If any doors are too narrow for the robots, I will need to consider alternative paths.\n",
    "   - **Accessible Robots:** \n",
    "     - Assuming the doors are wide enough for robots 4 and 10, both can access room 309.\n",
    "   - **Reasoning:** If any robot cannot fit through a door, I will need to find an alternate route or check if the door sizes can accommodate the robot's width.\n",
