To identify the target defect node, we need to find the ceiling element associated with room id 309 in the 3D scene graph. The ceiling elements are identified by their type and the corresponding room they belong to. The ceiling in room id 309 can be identified by searching for the ceiling element with the location coordinates that match room id 309.\n",

    "4. **Check Accessibility:**\n",
